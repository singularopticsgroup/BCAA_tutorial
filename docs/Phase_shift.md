## [](#header-2)Phase shift

This function is responsible for the generation of a constant phase shift (plane wave). 
Users can specify the phase shift amount in degrees and the final phase shift 
is simultaneously represented in both degrees and radians ('x' π).

As an example, the optical vortex has been shifted by 90 degrees, which rotated the vortex map accordingly.
