## [](#header-2)Gaussian beam

This function is responsible for the Gaussian beam generation. Where the basic Gaussian beam equation, assuming that the propagation path equals 0 (z=0), is [1]:
<p align="center">
\(E(x,y) = exp(\frac{-\rho^2}{w_{0}^2})\), where \(\rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\)
<p>
The  \(w_{0}\) is a beam waist, which users can control.

The generated amplitude map is presented below:
