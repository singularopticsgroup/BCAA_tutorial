This tutorial was created to ensure support for the Binary Complex Amplitude App (BCAA), which was created in MATLAB software. Created to control over beam shaping processes. BCAA allows user to control both the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and an external camera.

To operate, it requires a MATLAB R2020 or newer with an active Image Acquisition Toolbox, MATLAB Support for MinGW-w64 C/C++/Fortran Compiler and optional Add-ons that enable MATLAB â€“ camera communication. Moreover the Digital Micromirror Device with a ViALUX motherboard and the ViALUX alp4.4 dll drivers available at https://www.vialux.de/de/download.html are required.


The application is divided into two sections. The left section stands as an **Device communication** one, allowing the user to see what kind of hologram is currently displayed at the DMD Screen, to load external data or control the external camera. The right section is responsible for **Graphic User Interface** - the modification of hologram parameters as well as for operating the beam correction algorithms.
